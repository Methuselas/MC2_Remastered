"""check-light-loop-numlights-bound.py — LIGHT-CLAMP-RAISE-STAGE1-1 invariant.

Protects the single load-bearing invariant that makes raising the runtime
per-object light clamp (16 -> 32, kRuntimeLightClamp in mclib/txmmgr.cpp) SAFE:

    Every per-light loop in the lighting CONSUMER shaders must be bounded by the
    POPULATED count `min(<ld>.numLights.x, MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD)`, NEVER by the
    declared ABI cap MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD alone.

If a consumer loop iterates the fixed cap (0..MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD) regardless of
numLights.x, then raising the clamp would let it (a) read uninitialised slots
16..31 and (b) inflate per-fragment cost to a flat 32 lights everywhere. Both
are corruption / perf regressions. The clamp raise is only safe because these
loops follow numLights.x. This checker is the tripwire for "someone rewrites a
loop to use the bare cap".

SCOPE (lighting consumers only):
  shaders/include/lighting.hglsl
  shaders/mech.vert
  shaders/static_prop.vert

DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED:
  shaders/lightgrid_build.comp — the froxel / clustered light-grid build path
  loops the FIXED cap (LIGHTGRID_MAX_LIGHTS) BY DESIGN (it bins every potential
  slot), and it is DEFERRED / gated off (not on the Stage-1 shading path). It is
  not a per-object populated-count consumer, so the invariant does not apply.

Logic per file:
  - Find every `for (...)` loop.
  - Determine its bound token (the comparison RHS in the loop condition).
  - A loop is COMPLIANT if its bound is a local variable that is assigned from
    `min(... .numLights.x ..., MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD)` earlier in the file.
  - A loop is a VIOLATION if its condition compares directly against
    `MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD` (the bare cap) as the iteration bound.
  - Loops whose bound is unrelated to lights (e.g. shadow cascades) are ignored:
    we only flag loops that index a light array (light_dir/light_color/
    light_falloff/light_to_world) or whose bound is MAX_LIGHTS_IN_WORLD.

Exit 0 if all light loops are numLights-bound; nonzero + diagnostics otherwise.
