# RenderWorld Slice M4: firewall enforcing the rule that VFX shaders
# MUST NOT write color-attachment-2 (the M1.5 R32_UINT objectID substrate).
#
# Why this exists: integer color attachments do not blend (GL 4.5 §17.3.6).
# An additive/alpha-blended particle fragment that writes attachment-2 will
# LAST-WRITE-WINS clobber the opaque mech/static-prop objectID underneath,
# silently breaking M2.6 mech-pick on any mech occluded by a translucent
# particle (muzzle flash, smoke, tracer, impact effect). The user clicks
# the mech, nothing happens — no log line marks the failure. Hard to
# debug from the gameplay symptom back to the FS shader source.
#
# Cure: prohibit `layout(location=2) out` declarations in VFX shaders.
# Enforced mechanically — a contributor who tries to add the write hits
# CI failure immediately rather than three months later when a player
# reports flaky mech-pick.

# Scan set: VFX shader basenames. At M4 ship time the only VFX shader pair
# is shaders/particle_billboard.{vert,frag}. Extend BASENAMES below when
# adding a new VFX shader file. See M4 spec §6 (surface table) + §12
# trap 3 (scan-set drift risk).
#
# Negative-test (to verify the script catches violations):
#   1. Temporarily add `layout(location=2) out uint v_test;` to
#      shaders/particle_billboard.frag (the declaration alone is enough;
#      no need to write to it).
#   2. Run this script. Expect exit 1 + the file:line reported.
#   3. Revert the injection (`git checkout shaders/particle_billboard.frag`).
#   4. Re-run. Expect exit 0.
#
# Exit 0 = clean (zero non-allowlisted matches across scan set)
# Exit 1 = at least one non-allowlisted violation
