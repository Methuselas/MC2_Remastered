"""FRAME-RESOURCE-FEEDBACK-CHECKER-1 — scene-color feedback-loop guard.

THE RULE (simple + brutal): no pass may sample the LIVE scene color attachment
`sceneColorTex_` (COLOR0) while it could be the active render target. Mid-frame
consumers (VFX distortion, blackbody, soft-color particles, projected decals) MUST
sample the feedback-safe copy `sceneColorCopyTex_` (via getSceneColorCopyTexture()),
which is snapshotted by copySceneColorForVfx() before VFX draws. This protects the
scene-color-grab / distortion work from the classic read-from-bound-attachment loop.

Mechanism: scan the render source for any `glBindTexture*(..., sceneColorTex_)`
sampler bind. A bind is ALLOWED only if it is either
  (a) the allocation/config bind (immediately after glGenTextures(&sceneColorTex_)), or
  (b) explicitly justified with an inline `FEEDBACK-SAFE:` comment within 3 lines
      (e.g. the endScene composite resolve, whose target is the backbuffer).
Any other live-color sampler bind FAILS — use the copy or justify it.

Also asserts the safe path still exists: copySceneColorForVfx + sceneColorCopyTex_ +
getSceneColorCopyTexture, so the copy plumbing can't be silently deleted out from
under the consumers.

Scope note (v1): guards `sceneColorTex_` only. `sceneDepthTex_` / `sceneNormalTex_`
are legitimately sampled live by post-fx (depth-write OFF, COLOR1 not in the
SingleColor draw set) — the accepted read-only pattern, NOT a feedback loop — so they
are out of scope here. The static table check (check-pass-attachment-contract.py)
already enforces the write+read-same-attachment rule across all attachments.

Exit 0 = PASS.
