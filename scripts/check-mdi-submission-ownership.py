"""MDI-SUBMISSION-SCAFFOLD-1 — indirect-draw submission ownership checker.

Geometry enters a pass via an indirect draw (glMultiDraw*Indirect / glDraw*Indirect).
MDI-SUBMISSION-LEDGER-RECON-1 catalogued every submitter. This checker keeps the
submission layer observable so a new indirect submitter can't slip in unnamed (the
terrain rake at the draw-submission level).

THE RULE (TU-level, robust to line drift): any translation unit that issues a real
indirect draw MUST (a) #include "mdi_submit.h" and (b) contain at least one
mdi_submit::trace(...) call, so every indirect-submitting file participates in the
[MDI_SUBMIT] self-report. A file that adds an indirect draw without wiring the scaffold
FAILs.

Also asserts the ledger doc exists (docs/render-backend-seams/mdi-submission-ledger-recon-1.md).

Comments/strings mentioning the GL calls are ignored — only real call statements count.

Exit 0 = PASS.
