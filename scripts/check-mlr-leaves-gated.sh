# Verifies that all 4 MLR work-leaves in mclib/mlr/mlrclipper.cpp have
# MC2_GOSFX_GATE_EARLY_RETURN() near the top of their bodies. A1 wired
# these as the first env-gate that converts gosFX rendering into a no-op
# under MC2_DISABLE_GOSFX=1. Removing any of these gates silently brings
# gosFX particles back without changing default — this script trips loud.
#
# A4 deletes mclib/mlr/ entirely, so this script self-retires (its scan
# range disappears). Until then it lives as a tier-1 invariant.
