# FRAME-SKIP-SAFETY-AUDIT-1

## Executive Summary

**The Rule:** Per-frame skip fast-paths (continue, return, early-exit branches) that avoid expensive work MUST preserve the cheap liveness stamps that downstream consumers require. Example: the R2B-STATIC-NATURAL-TOUCH-PRESERVE-1 fix (commit 07a1f8ac) added `mc2R2bTouchStaticLiveness()` stamping inside the skip to prevent stale `cachedFrame_` — the registry flush was dropping trees because their shapes' frame stamps weren't refreshed when update() was skipped.

**Scope:** This audit inventories every per-frame skip site in the update/touch/render/submit paths and classifies each by whether it preserves required liveness and frame contracts.

| 6524 | BldgAppearance::touch (Path B, terrain loop) | — | early return if touchSerialCommitFrame==g_mc2FrameCounter | (none) | legacy shape touch prepass | SAFE_WITH_STAMP — stamp is set in touchSerialCommit (4246) BEFORE stable-skip, so Path B correctly skips when Phase 2 already ran |

### GameOS/gameos/gos_static_prop_registry.cpp

| Line | Owner | Gate Var | Skipped Work | Skipped Stamp | Consumer | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|--------|

| 1036 | registryFlush loop | — | **skip (continue) if rng.multi->getCachedFrame()!=currentFrame** | cachedFrame_ (NOT refreshed — the skip detects the staleness; underlying bug is in update/touch) | static draw list | **NEEDS_TRACE** — this is the key consumer-boundary counter: `s_diag_ranges_stale_after_drawn` counts registered props whose frame stamp drifted. Rising/persistent counts for on-screen typeIDs = upstream stamping bug (the R2B-STATIC-NATURAL-TOUCH-PRESERVE-1 class). Diagnostic: `MC2_STATIC_STALE_DROP_FATAL` aborts on regression. |

## NEEDS_TRACE Shortlist

Ranked by consumer-boundary impact and confidence that instrumentation will catch real regressions:

### 1. **GpuStaticPropRegistry::flush() — stale_after_drawn counter** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - **Counter Name:** `s_diag_ranges_stale_after_drawn` (already exists, gos_static_prop_registry.cpp:1012)
   - **Consumer Boundary:** registry flush loop (line 987–1036) vs. update/touch stamping paths (objmgr.cpp:2750, bdactor.cpp:4246, 6573)
   - **Why Instrument:** This counter directly detects the R2B-STATIC-NATURAL-TOUCH-PRESERVE-1 regression class. If a skip path fails to stamp cachedFrame_, the registry drop happens silently unless this counter is monitored. **Rising or persistent per-frame counts for on-screen typeIDs = upstream stamping bug.**
   - **Deployment:** Wire into smoke CI: alert if `stale_after_drawn` > 0 for any on-screen mission (mc2_01, mc2_10, mc2_24). Current status: implemented (stderr emit + `MC2_STATIC_STALE_DROP_FATAL` gate for CI).
   - **Related Env Vars:** `MC2_STATIC_STALE_DROP_FATAL` (abort on regression), `MC2_SKIP_STATIC_TREES_DIAG` (legacy per-type summary), `MC2_R2B_STATIC_NATURAL_TRACE` (R2B skip path trace)

### 2. **BldgAppearance::touchSerialCommit() — double-touch prevention** (Priority: HIGH)
   - **Counter Name:** `s_touchEntryDiag.legacy_skipped` (already exists, bdactor.cpp:2879–2896)
   - **Consumer Boundary:** touchSerialCommit() (line 4246 stamp) vs. Path B touch() (line 6524–6526 stamp-check early-return)
   - **Why Instrument:** Verifies that FRAME-JOBS-2F stamp-unification (Phase 2 marks frame, Path B checks stamp) is working. Counter should be ~100% of Path B touch() calls on missions running FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH (split enabled). If counter stays 0, the stamp logic is broken and Path B will double-run work.
   - **Deployment:** Wire into smoke CI: assert `legacy_skipped / total_Path_B_calls > 0.95` when `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH=1`. Currently printed every 300 frames when `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH_DIAG=1`.
   - **Related Env Vars:** `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH` (gate), `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH_DIAG` (diagnostic)

### 3. **BldgAppearance::touchSerialCommit() — stableLightSkip eligibility** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - **Counter Name:** `s_stableLightSkipDiag.skip` (already exists, bdactor.cpp:2745–2766, printed at `s_lbssDiag`)
   - **Consumer Boundary:** touchSerialCommit() stableLightSkipEligible check (line 4263–4269) vs. ResubmitCachedGpuLightData() call (line 4452)
   - **Why Instrument:** Tracks how often the stable-skip fires (eligible && armed). Should be high on stable missions (mc2_10 ~99% at steady state). If it drops unexpectedly (needsFullBakeNextFrame spike, registration loss), the building will re-submit every frame instead of using cached slots, visible as perf regression.
   - **Deployment:** Wire into smoke perf regression gates: if `skip_rate < baseline_skip_rate * 0.8` (where baseline = mission average), flag for investigation. Printed every 300 frames when `MC2_LIGHTBRIDGE_STABLE_SKIP_DIAG=1`.
   - **Related Env Vars:** `MC2_LIGHTBRIDGE_STABLE_SKIP` (enable), `MC2_LIGHTBRIDGE_STABLE_SKIP_DIAG` (diagnostic)

### 4. **GpuStaticPropRegistry::flush() — proxy candidate classification** (Priority: MEDIUM-LOW)
   - **Counter Name:** `g_spr_proxyCandidate`, `g_spr_rejNoStaticReg`, etc. (already exist, bdactor.cpp:52–62)
   - **Consumer Boundary:** touchSerialCommit() stableLightSkipEligible evaluation vs. STATIC-SCENE-PROXY-RECON classification (bdactor.cpp:4287–4409, 6596–6620)
   - **Why Instrument:** RECON-only (no behavior change). Identifies buildings/trees stable enough to skip touch() entirely. Rejection breakdown (no_shape, no_static_reg, bad_light_idx, needs_full_bake) reveals structural issues (e.g., mc2_24 72% rej_no_static_reg = off-screen buildings never registered). Baseline mission profiles guide future STATIC-SCENE-PROXY optimization slices.
   - **Deployment:** Archive per-mission baseline profiles (recon=1 soak runs). Compare new baseline after changes to detect registration/stability regressions early.
   - **Related Env Vars:** `MC2_STATIC_PROXY_RECON` (enable), `MC2_STATIC_REG_COVERAGE` (sub-classify rejections)

### 5. **code/objmgr.cpp — FRAME-JOBS-1 prepass skip rate** (Priority: LOW)
   - **Counter Name:** `frameJobsPrePassCount` (already instrumented, line 2340, printed per-frame when `MC2_FRAME_JOBS=1` and trace enabled)
   - **Consumer Boundary:** parallelForRange() (line 2346) candidate filter vs. isRecalcBoundsWorkerSafe() gate (line 2355)
   - **Why Instrument:** Tracks how many objects are whitelisted for parallel recalcBounds. Should be stable per mission. If it drops (appearance type disqualified), prepass perf gains diminish. Diagnostic only; low priority.
   - **Deployment:** Smoke trace (`MC2_FRAME_JOBS=1 + MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TRACE=1`) captures this. Manual review for appearance-type changes.
   - **Related Env Vars:** `MC2_FRAME_JOBS`, `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_BATCH`, `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TRACE`

## Key Findings

1. **R2B-STATIC-NATURAL-TOUCH-PRESERVE-1 is the historical regression class:** The skip at objmgr.cpp:2753 (continue for static trees) and 2788 (continue for static buildings) now preserve cachedFrame_ via mc2R2bTouchStaticLiveness() when MC2_R2B_TOUCH_PRESERVE=1 (default-ON). Regression signature: GpuStaticPropRegistry::flush() detects stale multi-shapes at line 987 and emits `[STATIC_PROP_REGISTRY]...stale_frame_drop_after_drawn`. The counter `s_diag_ranges_stale_after_drawn` is the regression detector.

2. **FRAME-JOBS-2F split-phase introduces new stamp contract:** touchSerialCommit() sets touchSerialCommitFrame unconditionally (bdactor.cpp:4246, 6573) BEFORE the stable-skip return. This allows Path B touch() to stamp-check and early-return correctly, preventing double-work. The contract is verified by `s_touchEntryDiag.legacy_skipped` counter (printed when `MC2_FRAME_JOBS_TOUCH_DIAG=1`).

3. **LIGHTBRIDGE-STABLE-SKIP-WIRE-1 preserves slot liveness via INVARIANT:** Baked static-prop light slots [0..s_staticLightHighWater) persist frame-to-frame; skipping EmitBakedGpuLightData doesn't stale them because the GPU buffer upload keeps them valid (renderLists() always covers the range). The cached slot index from prior frame remains correct.

4. **Most skip sites are trivial gate-checks (NULL, bounds, conditions):** Only the following are load-bearing per-frame skips that warrant regression tests:
   - objmgr.cpp:2753, 2788 (R2B-STATIC-NATURAL) — instrumented by `s_diag_ranges_stale_after_drawn`
   - bdactor.cpp:4440, 6633 (LIGHTBRIDGE-STABLE-SKIP) — instrumented by `s_stableLightSkipDiag.skip`
   - bdactor.cpp:6521, 6526 (touch Path B early-return) — instrumented by `s_touchEntryDiag.legacy_skipped`
   - gos_static_prop_registry.cpp:976 (cachedFrame stale check) — detector counter `s_diag_ranges_stale_after_drawn`
