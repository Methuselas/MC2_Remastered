# Buffer Lifetime Ledger

Maintained inventory of high-risk renderer GPU buffers by hazard class. Companion to
[buffer-lifetime-ownership-recon-1](buffer-lifetime-ownership-recon-1.md). Machine-read by
`scripts/check-buffer-lifetime-ownership.py` (registered `buffer_lifetime`). Source-verified
vs nifty `4bd55403`.

Classes: **A** fence-guarded ring · **B** GPU-produced + glMemoryBarrier · **C**
static/immutable per-mission · **D** implicit-sync (no fence/ring/explicit barrier —
GL-safe, Vulkan-debt) · **E** sticky-bit temporal accumulator.

The table below is parsed: `| symbol | class | producer | sync | TU |` (one buffer per row;
`sync` names the fence/barrier/none mechanism).

## Known stale telemetry

- `gpu_drawn_instances` — reads CPU-side count that is 0 under live GPU-authority path;
  declared in [objbatcher-zero-gpu-drawn-recon-1](objbatcher-zero-gpu-drawn-recon-1.md).
  Retire or readback-gate (STALE-COUNTER-RETIRE-1).

## What the checker enforces (FAIL)

1. Every ledger row declares a class in {A,B,C,D,E}.
2. **Class-B COMMAND barrier presence** — `gpu_cull_compute.cpp` and
   `gos_terrain_indirect.cpp` each contain a `GL_COMMAND_BARRIER_BIT` glMemoryBarrier
   (removing the barrier that fences GPU-produced indirect buffers → FAIL).
3. **Class-D Vulkan-debt declared** — at least the known class-D buffers are listed so the
   implicit-sync migration debt stays visible.
4. **Stale counter declared** — `gpu_drawn_instances` is documented as known-stale.

## Open (next slices)

- STALE-COUNTER-RETIRE-1 (make gpu_drawn_instances honest).
- LIGHT-BUFFER-BARRIER-VERIFY-1 / PARTICLE-BUFFER-LIFETIME-1 (class-D: confirm/insert the
  explicit barrier or ring; freshest highest-touch risk).
