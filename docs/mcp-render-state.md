# MC2 Render-State MCP Server

Read-only MCP bridge from Claude agents to the running MC2 engine and smoke
artifacts. No engine mutation, no command queue, no networking inside mc2.exe.

## Quick start

**Step 1 — enable the state dump and launch the game**

```bat
set MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP=1
set MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP_HISTORY=1
cd A:\Games\mc2-opengl\mc2-win64-v0.4
mc2.exe
```

The engine writes `debug_state/latest_render_state.json` every 300 frames and
8 rolling history slots (`history_0.json` … `history_7.json`) when history is
enabled. The dump gate is **off by default** — no disk traffic without the env
var.

**Step 2 — open a Claude Code session in the worktree**

```
claude   (from A:\Games\mc2-opengl-src\.claude\worktrees\nifty-mendeleev\)
```

The project `.mcp.json` at the worktree root auto-registers `mc2-render-state`.
No manual `/mcp add` needed.

**Step 3 — confirm the server is connected**

In the Claude Code chat, type `/mcp`. You should see `mc2-render-state` listed
with status `connected`.

## Available tools

### State read tools (require game running with MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP=1)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_render_state` | Full latest snapshot as JSON |
| `get_render_health` | Compact health summary — ok flag + all mismatch counters |
| `get_feature_gates` | All MC2_* feature gate states at last snapshot |
| `get_visual_settings` | IBL/SH ambient, PBR specular, dispatch path, material debug |
| `get_history(slot)` | One history ring slot (0=oldest, 7=newest); needs HISTORY=1 |
| `validate_state` | Schema validation — PASS or FAIL with specific errors |
| `get_frame_info` | Frame index, mission name, build config — lightweight orient |

### Capture and artifact tools (MC2-MCP-WRAPPER-2)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_capture_baseline(mission, duration)` | Single-mission smoke run; blocks ~duration+15s; returns report summary |
| `list_capture_sets` | All artifact dirs newest-first with per-mission results |
| `summarize_latest_capture` | Detailed report for the newest artifact dir |
| `get_latest_artifact_paths` | All files + sizes in the newest artifact dir |

`run_capture_baseline` wraps `run_smoke.py --tier adhoc --kill-existing --keep-logs`.
It terminates any running mc2.exe before starting, so do not call it while
manually running the game and expecting it to stay alive.

## Example workflow — quick health check

```
get_frame_info         # orient: which mission, what build
get_render_health      # check ok flag and mismatch counters
get_visual_settings    # inspect IBL/PBR strengths and dispatch path
validate_state         # full schema validation pass/fail
```

## Example workflow — regression check after a code change

```
run_capture_baseline("mc2_01", 30)   # run one mission smoke
summarize_latest_capture             # read the report
get_latest_artifact_paths            # locate log files if result != PASS
```

## Example workflow — IBL tuning session

1. Launch game with `MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP=1`.
2. Adjust IBL strength via ImGui slider in-game.
3. Wait ~5s for next dump (300 frames at 60fps).
4. `get_visual_settings` — confirm new strength visible in snapshot.
5. `get_render_health` — confirm ok=true, no mismatch counters raised.

## Configuration reference

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP` | off | Enable periodic JSON dump |
| `MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP_DIR` | `debug_state` | Output directory (relative to mc2.exe CWD) |
| `MC2_DEBUG_STATE_DUMP_HISTORY` | off | Enable rolling 8-slot history ring |
| `MC2_DEPLOY_DIR` (MCP server) | `A:/Games/mc2-opengl/mc2-win64-v0.4` | Override deploy dir for state file reads |

`MC2_DEPLOY_DIR` is read by the MCP server process, not by mc2.exe. Set it in
`.mcp.json` `env` block if your deploy path differs from the default.
