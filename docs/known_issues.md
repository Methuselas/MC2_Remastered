## Editor: generated-map path divergence (architectural debt, no active bug)

- **Generated maps use a divergent terrain bring-up (`EditorData::initTerrainFromTGA` ~1561-1731) instead of the proven stock `.pak` load path (`initTerrainFromPCV`/`Terrain::load`).** Greybeard ruled META-FIX = converge them; DEFERRED as justified debt. **Blocker:** no standalone generated-`.pak` writer exists — `tools/terrain_gen/pak_exporter.py` only `patch_pak()`s Packet 0 of a same-grid template (`--template-pak`); no tacmap/MOVE writer; shipping design is deliberately `.elev.r32`+burnin → `setVertexHeight` direct apply (terrain_gen.py:285). Completing it = full PacketFile writer = a dedicated terrain-export session, not an editor session. **NO active bug:** the hardened `EditorDebugOverlay` Terrain Probe (`MC2_TERRAIN_PROBE=1` headless, or Debug Overlays panel) proved the direct-apply path correct — `file==vert==mesh` (68-399), `water=0`, recipe+colormap ready. The earlier "71% underwater" was an `if(water)` miscount of `PostcompVertex.water` dither-marker bits (0x40/0x80); renderer uses `water & 1` (quad.cpp:1008). `eye->reset()` is NOT a terrain fix (`EditorCamera::reset()` only deletes sky+compass). Full record: `memory/debt_generated_map_pak_convergence.md`.

## Player-visible issues

Known bugs that affect anyone running the game. Full detail in the beta doc:
[docs/beta/known_issues.md](beta/known_issues.md)

- **Shadow stutter** when the camera jumps more than ~500 units in one move. Panning is smooth; only large instant jumps trigger it.
- **Shadow banding** shifts slightly with camera rotation due to view-dependent tessellation.
- **Water shoreline z-fight** visible when zooming in or changing elevation (not on pan).
- **First-launch black terrain** (intermittent) — relaunch the mission; second load is normal.
- **Options menu writes bad resolution** to `options.cfg` on 4K displays. Delete `<game-deploy-dir>\options.cfg` to reset.
- **Bloom/FXAA/tonemapping apply to HUD** — scene and HUD share the same framebuffer.

## Developer / Internal

Extracted from CLAUDE.md 2026-05-24. Issues here are KNOWN — don't re-discover
them. Add new findings as new bullets; remove fixed ones outright (don't append
"FIXED" — delete the bullet).

## GL state / render-state cache (META-FIX DEBT)

- **No mechanical GL-state save/restore contract for GPU-direct passes (GREYBEARD: GlStateGuard meta-fix, deferred 2026-06-01).** GPU-direct passes (particle bridge, water fast path, mech/static-prop batchers, terrain bridges, post-process, shadow direct draws) set blend/cull/depth via RAW GL that bypasses the gos render-state cache (`gos_SetRenderState`/`applyRenderStates`, single `stateCacheValid_` bit). Each must manually (a) save/restore touched slots and (b) call `gos_InvalidateRenderStateCache()` — enforced only by comment + discipline. The invalidation call-site list at `gameos_graphics.cpp:1565` has grown to ~14 entries = the footprint of the gap. Failures this class produced: explosion cards backface-culled (sub-pass `copySceneDepthForParticles` re-enabled GL_CULL_FACE mid-flush), water vanished (inherited SimpleCamera `SetBackFaceOn`), stale-cached blend on legacy MLR draws after a raw-GL pass. **Meta-fix:** a `GlStateGuard` RAII scope (snapshot slots + set on ctor; restore + `gos_InvalidateRenderStateCache()` on dtor) wrapping every GPU-direct pass; sub-passes get an inner guard. Collapses the 14-item manual list to zero, makes the bug class impossible by construction. No-behavior-change refactor; touches all ~14 sites in one coordinated slice. Interim patches landed 2026-06-01 (particle-bridge cull re-assert + bridge/water cache-invalidate) — substitutive for the visible flicker; the guard refactor remains the upstream fix.

## Shadows

- **Shadow re-render stutter when camera moves >500 units.** Fix: static world-fixed shadow map (design ready).
- **Shadow banding shifts with camera rotation** (view-dependent terrain geometry).
- **Dynamic prop shadows: no light-box cull yet** — with MC2_SHADOW_DYNAMIC_PROP_CASTERS=1 the dynamic pass draws ALL registered non-building props every frame (visibility-independent, depth-only) regardless of the light box. Cheap now; **HZB is the planned long-term fix**. Interim: CPU light-box AABB cull (must cull vs the LIGHT box, not the camera frustum). See `memory/shadow_dynamic_projection_and_caster_feed_fixed.md`.
- **Static building shadow goes stale on destroy** — MC2_STATIC_PROP_BUILDING_SHADOW bakes the world-fixed building shadow map once per mission; destroyed buildings keep their shadow until reload.
- **Foliage shadow alpha-discard (SHADOW-FOLIAGE-ALPHA-DISCARD-1, deferred)** — tree cards cast solid-quad shadows (the alpha cutout isn't applied in the depth-only shadow program).

## Water / terrain rendering

- **Water shoreline z-fight on zoom/elevation-change (NOT pan); water sits slightly low** (pre-existing). Interim fast-path fixes shipped 2026-05-17. Full state: `memory/water_fastpath_interim_fixes_and_residuals.md`.
- **Terrain transparency / flicker during fast pan** (pre-existing ring-buffer coherency race, NOT a regression). When the camera pans quickly, brief transparent patches appear on the terrain. Root cause documented at `GameOS/gameos/gos_terrain_indirect.cpp` ~line 2660-2668: the thin-record ring-buffer fence wait can expire, producing a RAW hazard where the CPU overwrites a slot the GPU may still be reading. Effect is masked when the camera is stationary (thin-record content is frame-to-frame identical under no-motion). To confirm this is NOT caused by tile-retirement (COLORMAP-TILES-RETIRE-1): launch with `MC2_SETUPTEXTURES_LEGACY_FORCE=1` and pan at the same speed — the artifact reproduces identically with the 400-tile path active. Diagnostic gate: `MC2_RING_TRACE=1` writes `ring_trace.log` with per-frame fence wait timings and MVP fingerprints.

## Terrain LOD chunk renderer (NOW DEFAULT-ON, `MC2_TERRAIN_LOD_CHUNK=0` opts out)

- **DEFAULT-ON since 2026-06-09 (`a7b090be`).** The chunk path is now the default
  terrain renderer (single-source gate `mc2TerrainLodChunkEnabled()`); full tier1
  5/5 PASS on the no-flag chunk path. Set `MC2_TERRAIN_LOD_CHUNK=0` for the legacy
  tessellated path. **EDITOR:** now on the chunk path and rendering correctly (fixed
  2026-06-10) — the editor frame loop was building the chunk draw commands
  (`land->render()`) but never submitting them: `Terrain::flushDrawCommands()` lived
  only in `code/gamecam.cpp:388`, so under the default-on chunk path (which suppresses
  the legacy per-quad draw) terrain rendered BLACK (only overlays drew). Fixed by
  mirroring the game's flush in `EditorCamera::render` (after shadow/compass, before
  `renderLists()`). If terrain misbehaves, `MC2_TERRAIN_LOD_CHUNK=0` still falls back
  to legacy.
- The chunk path reached parity with legacy (stitching/shadows/smooth-normal/
  material+colour/concrete+cement-atlas + all ImGui tunables). Full record + the
  3 load-bearing depth/MVP rules:
  `memory/HANDOFF_2026_06_09_terrain_lod_chunk_phase10_fidelity_cutover_prep.md`.
- **RESOLVED (do not re-discover) — three chunk-ONLY bugs were depth/MVP/early-Z,
  NOT a "matrix divergence":** water-recede-on-zoom (net depth must be -0.004, the
  legacy thin path double-applies the fudge), shore-water-dropout-on-pitch +
  decal-tearing-on-zoom (chunk must project with the baked dispatch MVP
  `IsFrameSolidArmed()?getDispatchMvp16():live` — frame N-1 — that water-cull/decals
  use, else a 1-frame offset), and the early-Z violation (bias PRE-DIVIDE in the
  vert, never frag `gl_FragDepth`). All fixed (`4da9cfb1`,`67e4f5e4`).
- Editor is now on the chunk path (see EDITOR note above, fixed 2026-06-10);
  interactive gameplay sanity (picking/gates/turrets) in the editor is still a
  worthwhile manual check.

## First-launch / startup

- **First-launch black terrain intermittency** — tier1 first mission occasionally renders black; second normal. Suspected: GPU/shader state dirty from previous mission teardown. Repro: tier1 with `--fail-fast`.

## Editor picking

- **Editor pick uses raw MFC client pixels vs GL viewport space (pre-existing, low-risk).** `EditorObjectMgr::getObjectAtScreenPosition` now forward-projects each object to screen via `Camera::projectForScreenXY` and matches by pixel distance (fixed the wrong-far-object pick; commit screen-space-pick). The click coords are raw MFC `CPoint` client pixels, while `projectForScreenXY` uses the `gos_GetViewport` GL viewport — same space the status bar uses, and they agree UNLESS the editor window is resized so GL viewport width != MFC client width (`EditorInterface.cpp:~4072` normalizes this for the gameplay-pick path but the status-bar/object-pick paths do not). Correct in the common no-resize case; if a resize-offset pick is ever reported, normalize the click coords the same way the gameplay pick does. Meta-fix history: `memory/editor_pick_screen_projection_metafix.md`.

## Editor smoke

- **MSBuild stale-object after a same-second edit (false smoke failure).** If a NEW `[ESMOKE v1]` field comes back missing / `None` from `run_editor_smoke.py` right after a `check-editor-build.sh --build-only` that printed PASS, the build likely SKIPPED recompiling a just-edited source: MSBuild's up-to-date check has ~1s timestamp granularity, so an edit landing in the same second as the prior object can be judged "up to date" and the deployed exe ships old code. **Diagnose before assuming a code/path bug:** confirm the field string is literally in the built exe — `powershell -NoProfile -Command "Select-String -Path 'build64/out/editor/RelWithDebInfo/Mission Editor.exe' -Pattern 'your_new_field' -SimpleMatch -Quiet"`. If ABSENT, force a recompile (touch the source: `(Get-Item editor/EditorMFC.cpp).LastWriteTime = Get-Date`) and rebuild + redeploy. Observed 2026-06-09 (validate_* fields). Memory: `memory/msbuild_stale_object_same_second_edit.md`.

- **Editor smoke launch flake (`0xC0000005`)** — `foliage_present` and `foliage_menu_commands` occasionally crash with `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` (`0xC0000005`, rc `3221225477`) ~1s into a **back-to-back full-suite** `run_editor_smoke.py` run, but PASS reliably **in isolation**. Suspected editor process teardown/startup contention or a deployed asset/runtime-state race (sibling of the first-launch black-terrain teardown intermittency above). **NOT introduced by the Scene Outliner / Inspector work** — those cases pass in the same runs. Policy (`run_case_with_retry`, visible quarantine): an `0xC0000005` failure is retried **once**; crash-then-pass → reported as `FLAKY_PASS` and the suite header is starred (`result=PASS* (.., N flaky-pass)`) so the run is never read as strictly clean; a double `0xC0000005` stays a hard FAIL. Only `0xC0000005` is retried. If it reappears outside foliage cases or as a double-fail, investigate teardown — do not raise the retry count. Memory: `memory/editor_smoke_foliage_launch_flake.md`.

## Options / config

- **Options menu writes bad ResolutionX/Y to options.cfg** (observed 4096x2160 on 4K). Engine UI canvas is 800x600 and self-scales; other values break HUD scale + video positioning. Diagnostic: `memory/options_cfg_resolution_drift.md`.

## Blocked slice work

- **Stage 0.5 §4 (renderVisible repoint) BLOCKED — empirically NO-GO 2026-05-20 EVENING.** Tentative ship `40a54b7` reverted as `dc2e8f6` (popping + black-textures + resurrected 2026-05-05 black-tree class). §2.5 sticky-bit (`91b6991`) shipped independently and is durable. §4 deferred to alpha-Stage 1 OR pivot to v4 (gate render on `blockVisBits[]` directly under sticky). Full: `memory/stage_0_5_section_4_blocked_on_readback_non_superset.md`.

## Default-on flags / state

- **drawPass-retirement decal static-bake (`MC2_TERRAIN_INDIRECT_OVERLAY`): DEFAULT-ON since Stage-6 flip `60f2ef8`** (only `=0` reverts). On default path both SOLID and OVERLAY are armed so per-quad `draw()` loop in `Terrain::render drawPass` is SKIPPED. Slice A+B WIRED & validated 2026-05-17. Remaining endpoint: user-driven substitutive non-COST_SPLIT Tracy proof + decal visual canary. Full state: `memory/drawpass_retirement_decal_bake_state_and_raster_sheet_trap.md`.

## RenderSnapshot ok gate

- ~~**mc2_10 `ok=0` due to `staticPropValidationFail` (`sp_fail=1`).**~~ **FIXED `7bdbd1fd`.** `invalidateStaticRegistration()` tombstoned the registry recipe but never called `retireRecord` on the matching `s_objectRecords` slot; the slot stayed `alive=true` with a tombstoned recipe, causing `sp_fail=1` from frame ~1706 onward. Fix: `retireRecord` call added. Requires re-validation of mc2_10 with `MC2_RENDER_SNAPSHOT_LOG=1` to confirm ok=1 throughout.

## RenderWorld arc residuals

- **MLR-rendered mechs do not write object IDs (M2.5 known gap).** M2.6 pickup will work only for GPU-batched mech pixels. Empirical tier1 data shows `mlr_mech_draws=0` across all 5 missions, so the gap is rare-in-practice. If tier1 ever shows `mlr_mech_draws>0`, M2.6 must preserve mover-first legacy fallback for those mechs and cannot claim full mech GPU-pick coverage. Counter: `[MECHBATCHER v1] event=mlr_mech_summary mlr_mech_draws=M` on per-mission summary.
- **gosFX dev-override broken under unified projection (F1 ship).** Running with `MC2_DISABLE_GOSFX=0` after F1 will render gosFX particles wrong: MLR's `mlrclipper.cpp:206-209,305,321,347` reads of `cameraToClip(2,2)` and `(3,2)` use stale MC2-pixel-homogeneous convention while the runtime uniforms drive shaders via the new GL convention (clip.w > 0 for in-front; polarity folded into `kAxisSwapMC2toGL` per addendum-rclipw-polarity.md). Default `MC2_DISABLE_GOSFX=1` (gate-dead MLR work-leaves) is unaffected. Runtime guard prints `[UNIFIED_PROJ v1] WARN:` stderr once per startup. Dev-override path re-enabled when MLR retirement Slices 1-5 ship.

## Asset / atlas pre-commit guards

- **Do NOT upscale the icon atlases.** `code/mechicon.cpp` hardcodes `unitIconX/Y` (32/38) and reads source-pixel offsets against `s_MechTextures->width` / `s_pilotTextures->width`. Oversized source TGAs (upscaler `*_4x_gpu/` or Magic's Unofficial Expansion overlay) scramble icon sub-rectangles. Keep all 9 icon atlases at FST-archive resolution + `mcl_pr_pilotskillicons.tga`. Pre-commit guard: `sh scripts/check-asset-scale-callers.sh`.
