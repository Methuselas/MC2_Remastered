# MechCommander 2 -- OpenGL Remastered

MechCommander 2 was released by Microsoft/FASA Interactive in 2001 and its source code was later made public. alariq did the heavy lifting of getting that source running on modern Windows and Linux over OpenGL. This project picks up from there and modernizes the entirety of the engine.

A game engine rewrite and modernization of MechCommander 2, originally built on top of [alariq's OpenGL port](https://github.com/alariq/mc2). This repo modernizes nearly everything about the backend of the game. Nearly all per-frame CPU work has been eliminated. Most but not all systems live on the GPU now. As of 6/27/2026, the backend is "Vulkanized" - not a Vulkan renderer, but all draw passes, GL states, etc. are owned and explicit. I have reworked the editor to be more user friendly, added an asset viewer, and an explicit mod pathway that supports community campaigns and mods. As of today, 19 campaigns and nearly 400 missions are supported.

## Building

Requires Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with MSVC v143. All third-party dependencies (SDL2, GLEW, zlib) are vendored as `3rdparty.zip` at the repo root (Git LFS). **Extract it before configuring:**

```bash
# one-time setup: extract vendored dependencies
cd <repo-root>
unzip 3rdparty.zip                # or right-click -> Extract Here
# you should now see 3rdparty/{cmake,include,lib,tracy}
```

Configure and build (note the **absolute** path to the 3rdparty folder -- relative paths won't resolve correctly at compile time):

```bash
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:/absolute/path/to/repo/3rdparty -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE=x64 -B build64
cmake --build build64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target mc2
```

Output lands at `build64/RelWithDebInfo/mc2.exe`.

**Always use `RelWithDebInfo`**. Release builds crash due to GL debug callback registration.

For detailed build and dependency information, see [BUILD-WIN.md](BUILD-WIN.md).

## Running

```bash
mc2.exe                     # normal gameplay
mc2.exe -mission mc2_01     # skip menus, load directly into a mission
```
