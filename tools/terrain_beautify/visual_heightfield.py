"""VISUAL-HEIGHTFIELD-BAKE-1: high-res VISUAL terrain heightfield (render-only).

Bakes a stock mission's coarse heightfield into a higher-resolution VISUAL height
layer that the renderer can later sample to displace terrain vertices for a
smoother/less-blocky silhouette — WITHOUT touching the gameplay heightfield
(pathing/grounding/LOS stay on the original coarse grid; see
VISUAL-HEIGHTFIELD-SIDECAR-RECON-1).

This first bake is deliberately BORING + SAFE: a factor-x bilinear upsample with a
CORNER-PINNED guarantee — every coarse vertex appears verbatim in the visual grid
(max corner error = 0). No aggressive reshaping yet (that's the later
PYRAMID-ISLAND-VISUAL-RESHAPE slice, which will use the protected mask). No .pak
write, no engine change.

Grid math (corner-pinned): coarse side N (N-1 cells). Visual side V = (N-1)*F + 1,
so visual[i*F, j*F] == coarse[i, j] exactly; the new interior verts bilerp between.
World extent is unchanged (finer stride within the same 128-wu cells), so the
visual grid is coincident with the coarse grid at every F-th vertex.

Outputs (in <out>/<mission>.beauty/):
    visual_height_<F>x.r32      float32 [V*V] row-major, world-unit elevations
    visual_height_preview.png   grayscale normalized

    visual_height_report.json   dims + corner-error proof + delta stats

                                0=no displacement (on/near buildings) .. 1=full

TERRAIN-REAUTH-UNPIN-1 adds `--reauth`: terrain-AWARE, corner-UNpinned re-authoring
(user ruling: "UN PIN THE CORNERS. KEEP THE SHAPE"). Taubin lambda|mu band-pass
smoothing on the 4x grid flattens coarse-cell faceting and rounds pyramid facet
edges into curves, while the LANDFORM is kept by construction + constraint:
  - Taubin pair passes are volume-preserving band-pass (landform band ~untouched);
  - coarse local extrema (peaks/pits) may move at most --shape-tolerance of their
    local relief; residual loss is re-injected as smooth Gaussian fields
    (multi-point / neighborhood-aware, NOT a per-vertex clamp);
  - total deviation from the bilinear baseline is soft-bounded (C1 tanh limiter)
    by --max-drift;
  - roads/overlay + building footprints stay pinned to the bilinear baseline
    (feathered, crease-free).
Gameplay height (MapData::blocks[]) is NEVER touched: render-only sidecar for the
MC2_TERRAIN_VISUAL_DISPLACE consumer. The companion visual_damp.r32 is the engine
Half-B seed: static object-proximity displacement fade (units/buildings stand on
true gameplay height).

CLIFF-SMOOTH-1 extends --reauth for giant TERRACED cliff faces (hard 100wu+
steps in silhouette, mc2_17-class). Two problems block the base recipe there:
(a) --max-drift 24 << step size, and (b) extrema-preservation pins the
staircase (every terrace edge is a coarse extremum). Fixes, all render-only:
  - SLOPE-ADAPTIVE DRIFT: max-drift becomes a FIELD. Flats keep the scalar
    --max-drift; the cliff mask (one-sided coarse slope > --cliff-slope-deg,
    dilated one ring, feathered on the fine grid) allows --cliff-drift.
  - CLIFF MELT: Taubin is band-pass BY DESIGN (the landform band passes), so
    terrace treads survive it. On the cliff weight only, plain weighted
    diffusion (--cliff-melt-passes) relaxes the staircase toward the harmonic
    (continuous-face) surface; flats stay calm (weight ~ 0).
  - EXTREMA RELAXATION (documented): extrema ON the cliff mask that are NOT
    regional summits/pits (7x7 window) are exempted from re-injection — it is
    the STEPS between peaks that melt; true peaks stay pinned.
  - CLIFF-NESS: under --mountainify, detail on the cliff mask is biased toward
    gradient-aligned striation (value noise directionally blurred ALONG the
    downhill direction, then ridged) — erosion runs DOWN the face instead of
    isotropic bumps. Modest amplitude, still drift-bounded + water-excluded.

SHORE-CONTOUR-1 extends --reauth for the BLOCKY WATERLINE (mc2_17 river): the
visible water edge is polygons where the coarse mesh crosses the water plane.
The waterline contour is extracted (marching squares at waterElev on the fine
grid), smoothed (arc-length Gaussian, --shore-smooth-radius coarse cells), and
the shore band (+/- --shore-band-cells) is reshaped so terrain crosses
waterElev exactly on the smoothed curve (below on the water side, above on the
land side, tanh-bounded by --shore-max-adjust). Mountainify detail is excluded
in the band; non-regional shore extrema are relaxed (true peaks pinned);
cook_shoreline masks re-cooked from the new bake follow the new intersection
automatically. Render-only, gameplay height untouched.

       cells), 2 rounds for overlapping features.
    4) Feathered structural pin: overlay (roads) + building footprints ride the
       bilinear baseline; feather width ~1 coarse cell so no crease at the pin
       boundary.

    MOUNTAINIFY (mountainify_amp > 0): feature-ADDING pass between (2) and (3).
    Ridged multifractal detail (deterministic from `seed`), amplitude-modulated
    by the rock-channel mask (steep OR high — control_map_tool classifier logic
    recomputed inline on the fine grid), zero-centered so ridges add and ravines
    carve. Flat valleys get ~nothing; steep faces get ridge/spur/talus break-up.
    Still bounded by max_drift (re-limited) and still subject to the extrema
    guarantee + structural pin ("same mountain, more mountain-like").

    CLIFF-SMOOTH-1 (cliff_drift > 0): terraced-cliff melting. See module
    docstring — cliff-weighted diffusion between (1) and (2), a slope-adaptive
    drift FIELD in (2)/(2b), non-regional extrema on the cliff mask exempted
    from re-injection in (3), and gradient-aligned striation blended into the
    mountainify detail on the cliff weight.

    SHORE-CONTOUR-1 (shore_smooth_radius > 0 and water_elev given): smooth-
    waterline bank reshape between (2) and (2b) — see shore_contour_reshape.
    Compose order: reauth smoothing -> shore-contour reshape -> mountainify
    (rock channel excluded in the shore band) -> extrema re-injection (non-
    regional extrema in the shore-band core relaxed, same pattern as the
    cliff relaxation; true peaks/pits stay pinned) -> structural pin (roads/
    bridges still win — they ride the bilinear baseline by contract).
